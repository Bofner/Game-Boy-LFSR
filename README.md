# Game Boy LFSR

An interactive, visual representation of a Linear Feedback Shift Register for use on the Game Boy and Super Game Boy. 

You can set and rest taps, set and rest bits, and run the LFSR one cycle at a time.

Built using the same base as Space Tonbow, hence some of the Tonbow file names
